# address_book

AddressBook is a Flutter sample app. It uses MySQL1 to store the data, so a MySQL database is required. The app is a standard Master / Detail application. The Master page is a listview that displays the contacts. The Detail page is a Form that allows creating or editing a contact, with validation. The TextFormFields use a number of the different options available for them.
